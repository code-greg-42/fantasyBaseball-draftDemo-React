This was split into two to show two stages of the fantasy baseball site. *This is the draft stage.*

Feel free to create a team and draft. A .txt keypair file will be downloaded upon creation that includes the information to access your new eth account.

This account will be associated with the created team and would be where any winnings would be sent in the event that you won the league.

Drafting is asynchronous and is done in tiers. There are 7 tiers of 10 players each, and 4 players are randomly chosen as your default options for each tier. Rerolls are available, but limited.

Upon selecting a player in a tier, the selection is sent to the blockchain to lock it in and make sure no player can cheat the RNG system.

Once all tiers are selected, your team is ready for the league to start! All team selections will be stored on IPFS at the pre-determined start time for the league, and the next phase, the scoring phase, will begin.

If you would like to test with an already created team, here is the info for one:

team name : lions for lambos

username : cryptoguy19

password : ethereum42
